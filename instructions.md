# Project Setup
Log in to CS50 IDE (https://ide.cs50.io/) using github. Create a directory called viva by typing **mkdir viva** in the command prompt and then hit enter. Go to the viva directory by typing **cd viva**. In the viva directory make two directories called **templates** and **static**. Store the html files in templates directory and css files in static directory. Store application.py, helpers.py, scheduler.db, requirements.txt in viva directory.
Staying in viva directory type **flask run** in the command prompt and hit enter. You will see a **link**. Clicking and opening the link you can interact with the entire web app.
